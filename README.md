# NLP-Project

NLP Project - Yelp reviews
This project classifies Yelp Reviews into 1 star or 5 star categories based off the text content in the reviews.

Data Set used: Yelp Review Data Set from Kaggle.

Each observation in this dataset is a review of a particular business by a particular user.

The "stars" column is the number of stars (1 through 5) assigned by the reviewer to the business. (Higher stars is better)

The "cool" column is the number of "cool" votes this review received from other Yelp users. All reviews start with 0 "cool" votes, and there is no limit to how many "cool" votes a review can receive. In other words, it is a rating of the review itself, not a rating of the business.

The "useful" and "funny" columns are similar to the "cool" column.

This exercise is from the Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp.
